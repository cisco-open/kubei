External GRPC Plugin example:

Motivation:
Use OpenClarity orchestration mechanism in order to orchestrate scans in your own custom environment.
Write your own scanning logic that runs on the platform of your choice. It can be a cloud provider,
a local file system, or whatever you want to scan.
OpenClarity control plane is agnostic to the platform in which the scanner runs and the way the actual scanning is happening.

Requirements:
The plugin needs to listen on a grpc port, which is accessible from OpenClarity control plane.

Write your own plugin:
1. Implement the proto methods.
2. Run the plugin as a grpc server.
3. Run OpenClarity and provide the plugin address via OPENCLARITY_EXTERNAL_PROVIDER_PLUGIN_ADDRESS env var.
