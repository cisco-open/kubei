# OpenClarity Project Goals

- **Increase the adoption of OpenClarity**: One of the primary goals of OpenClarity
  is to reduce the number of vulnerable VMs in the world. We hope to do this by
  getting more people involved in the project. This involves feature development,
  marketing efforts, improving the user experience, and providing additional
  documentation and resources to make it easier for users to get started.

- **Improve the accuracy of OpenClarity**: Another goal is to enhance the
  accuracy across all supported types of threat detection by improving the
  analysis and result merging logic performed by OpenClarity to reduce false
  positives. This involves researching and developing improved algorithms and
  heuristics used by OpenClarity.

- **Expand OpenClarity's functionality**: A third goal is to expand the
  functionality of OpenClarity by adding additional tools to each family, adding
  additional families of threats to detect, and integrating with other security
  tools to provide a more comprehensive security solution.

- **Foster a community around OpenClarity**: OpenClarity will only be successful if
  we foster a community of users and developers around the project. The health
  of OpenClarity depends on organizing events, creating a forum for users to drive
  requirements and use cases, and contributing to open-source projects related to
  OpenClarity. Building a strong community around OpenClarity will help it be more
  widely adopted and more effective at detecting and managing virtual machine
  threats.
